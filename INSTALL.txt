This software requires c++11 to build,
which is available in GCC >= 4.8 (on linux) and Clang >= 3.3 (on mac)

Dependencies:
-------------
   - Autoconf ( http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/ )
   - either...
       GNU Scientific Library ( http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ )
     or..
       Boost Library ( http://www.boost.org ) (see "-with-boost" below)
   - Zlib ( included with OS X and most Linuxes, http://www.zlib.net ) *
   - C++ compiler with C++11 and openmp support
       Note for macOS users: Use "libomp" to link openmp with Clang
       libomp is available through brew ( https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/libomp )


Steps:
------
   ./bootstrap.sh
   ./configure [--prefix=...] [--with-gsl=...] [--with-boost=...]
   make


Products:
---------
   - Executable fastANI



Configure options:
------------------
--prefix=</path/to/install>
  Installs binaries to bin/ and libraries to lib/ within this path. The default
  is /usr/local/, which will typically require sudo for make install. Must be
  absolute path.
--with-gsl=</path/to/gsl/>
  Where to find the GNU Scientific library install if not in the default
  location (/usr/local). Must be absolute path and should not include bin/ or
  lib/.
--enable-static-gsl
  Statically link the GNU Scientific library instead of dynamically. Be mindful
  of licensure if distributing.
--with-boost=</path/to/boost/>
  Use Boost from this location, instead of GSL. Must be absolute path and should
  not include bin/ or lib/. Will be statically linked. Be mindful of licensure
  if distributing.

* If Zlib is not installed in a standard system location (it usually is),
  CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS will have to be modified before making.
