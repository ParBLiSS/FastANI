FastANI is developed for fast alignment-free computation of whole-genome Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI). ANI is defined as mean nucleotide identity of orthologous gene pairs shared between two microbial genomes. FastANI supports pairwise comparison of both complete and draft genome assemblies. Its underlying procedure follows a similar workflow as described by [Goris et al. 2007](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17220447). However, it avoids expensive sequence alignments and uses [Mashmap](https://github.com/marbl/MashMap) as its MinHash based sequence mapping engine to compute the orthologous mappings and alignment identity estimates. Based on our experiments with complete and draft genomes, its accuracy is on par with [BLAST-based ANI solver](http://enve-omics.ce.gatech.edu/ani/) and it achieves two to three orders of magnitude speedup. Therefore, it is useful for pairwise ANI computation of large number of genome pairs. More details about its speed, accuracy and potential applications are described here: "[High-throughput ANI Analysis of 90K Prokaryotic Genomes Reveals Clear Species Boundaries](https://doi.org/10.1101/225342)". 

### Download and Compile

Clone the software from Github and follow [`INSTALL.txt`](INSTALL.txt) to compile the code. There is also an option to download dependency-free binary for Linux or OSX through the [latest release](https://github.com/ParBliSS/FastANI/releases).

### Usage Summary

* **Produce help page.** Quickly check the software usage and available command line options.

```sh
$ ./fastANI -h
```

* **One to One.** Compute ANI between single query and single reference genome:

```sh
$ ./fastANI -q [QUERY_GENOME] -r [REFERENCE_GENOME] -o [OUTPUT_FILE] 
```

Here QUERY\_GENOME and REFERENCE\_GENOME are the query genome assemblies in fasta or multi-fasta format.

* **One to Many.** Compute ANI between single query genome and multiple reference genomes:

```sh
$ ./fastANI -q [QUERY_GENOME] --rl [REFERENCE_LIST] -o [OUTPUT_FILE]
```

For above use case, REFERENCE\_LIST should be a file containing directory paths to reference genomes, one per line.

* **Many to Many.** When there are multiple query genomes and multiple reference genomes:

```sh
$ ./fastANI --ql [QUERY_LIST] --rl [REFERENCE_LIST] -o [OUTPUT_FILE]
```
Again, QUERY\_LIST and REFERENCE\_LIST are files containing paths to genomes, one per line.

In all above use cases, OUTPUT\_FILE will contain space delimited row(s) with query genome, reference genome, ANI value, count of bidirectional fragment mappings, and total query fragments. Alignment fraction (wrt. the query genome) is simply the ratio of mappings and total fragments. **NOTE:** No ANI output is reported for a genome pair if ANI value is much below 80%. Such case should be computed at [amino acid level](http://enve-omics.ce.gatech.edu/aai/).

Two genome assemblies are provided in [data](data) folder to do a quick test run. 

We suggest users to do an adequate quality check of their input genome assemblies (both reference and query), especially the N50 be â‰¥10 Kbp.

### An Example Run

* **One to One.** Here we compute ANI between *Escherichia coli* and *Shigella flexneri* genomes provided in the [data](data) folder.

```sh
$ ./fastANI -q data/Shigella_flexneri_2a_01.fna -r data/Escherichia_coli_str_K12_MG1655.fna -o fastani.out 
```

Expect output log in the following format in the console:

```sh
$ ./fastANI -q data/Shigella_flexneri_2a_01.fna -r data/Escherichia_coli_str_K12_MG1655.fna -o fastani.out 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Reference = [data/Escherichia_coli_str_K12_MG1655.fna]
Query = [data/Shigella_flexneri_2a_01.fna]
Kmer size = 16
Fragment length = 3000
ANI output file = fastani.out
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
....
....
INFO, skch::main, Time spent post mapping : 0.00310319 sec
```

Output is saved in file `fastani.out`, provided above using the `-o` option. 

```sh
$ cat fastani.out
data/Shigella_flexneri_2a_01.fna data/Escherichia_coli_str_K12_MG1655.fna 97.7443 1305 1608
```

Above output implies that the ANI estimate between *S. flexneri* and *E. coli* genomes is 97.7443. Out of the total 1608 sequence fragments from *S. flexneri* genome, 1305 were aligned as orthologous matches.

### Visualize Conserved Regions b/w Two Genomes

FastANI supports visualization of the reciprocal mappings computed between two genomes. 
Getting this visualization requires a one to one comparison using FastANI as discussed above, except an additional flag `--visualize` should be provided. 
This flag forces FastANI to output a mapping file (with `.visual` extension) that contains information of all the reciprocal mappings. 
Finally, an [R script](scripts) is provided in the repository which uses [genoPlotR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/genoPlotR/index.html) package to plot these mappings. 
Here we show an example run using two genomes: *Bartonella quintana* ([GenBank: CP003784.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CP003784.1)) and *Bartonella henselae* ([NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_005956.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_005956.1)).

```sh
$ ./fastANI -q B_quintana.fna -r B_henselae.fna --visualize -o fastani.out
$ Rscript scripts/visualize.R B_quintana.fna B_henselae.fna fastani.out.visual
```

Using above commands, we get a plot file fastani.out.visual.pdf displayed below. Each red line segment denotes a reciprocal mapping between two genomes, indicating their evolutionary conserved regions.

### Parallelization

As of now, FastANI doesn't support parallelization internally. However, for one-to-many or many-to-many genome comparisons, users can simply divide their reference database into multiple chunks, and execute them as parallel processes. We provide a [script](scripts) in the repository to randomly split the database for this purpose.

One way to parallelize is with `xargs`. In this example, we provide six queries (really two queries three times over), and also two references per query.  Output is saved in six separate files that can be combined in the next step.

    export FNA=$(ls data/*.fna)
    echo $FNA $FNA $FNA | xargs -P 6 -n 1 bash -c '
      for i in $FNA; do 
        ./fastANI -q $0 -r $i -o /dev/stdout; 
      done > tmp.$$.tsv
    '
    cat tmp.*.tsv > fastani.tsv
    rm tmp.*.tsv
